% Here you give a summary of your work and your results. This is like a management summary and should be written in a clear and easy language, without many difficult terms and without abbreviations. Everything you present here must be treated in more detail in the main report. You should not give any references to the report in the summary - just explain what you have done and what you have found out. Should NOT be more than two pages!
